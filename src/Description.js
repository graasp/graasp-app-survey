        Previous studies have shown a strong correlation between teams’ self
        evaluation of effectiveness and project success [7], but this does not
        help much when it comes to assessing the effectivenes of individual team
        members. Assessing individual teamwork skills is difficult. One may be
        able to see individual teamwork skills in a basketball game, but student
        engineering teams work over long periods of time both inside and outside
        the classroom. A more comprehensive approach is needed to accruately
        assess the individual teamwork skills of engineering students. Based on
        our operational definition of teamwork, we can address the most
        effective way to assess it. Although there are undoubtedly more, we have
        identified three main approaches toward teamwork assessment: independent
        observation, evaluating individual contributions, and peer reviews.
        These differences can often interfere with the group process. Each
        individual may think their approach is the only right way to proceed,
        when in fact a variety of approaches can be one of the advantages to a
        team effort. If students can be made to understand the approaches of
        others and their advantages, conflicts can be avoided. There are several
        instruments that can be utilized to evaluate individual tendencies, and
        the results for all team members when shared can help each to appreciate
        the approaches of others. One such instrument is the Kolbe A™ Conative
        Index [9] which provides specific information which is useful in
        teamwork situations. In particular, this index helps individuals to
        understand their instinctive methods of operation and those of others.
        This understanding helps to create a more effective group process and
        fosters greater team synergy.
